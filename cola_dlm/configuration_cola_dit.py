class ColaDiTConfig(PretrainedConfig):
    """Configuration for :class:`ColaDiTModel`.

    Parameterizes the **block-causal Diffusion Transformer prior**
    ``p_psi(z_0)`` of Cola DLM (Eq. 2.1.4 of the paper *Continuous
    Latent Diffusion Language Model*, arXiv:2605.06548). The DiT learns
    the vector field ``v_psi(z_t, t; z_0^(<b))`` of the continuous-flow
    prior (Eq. 2.1.2 / 2.1.7) under the visible set
    ``V_b = {sg(z_0^(<b)), z_t^(b)}`` (Eq. 2.2.3).

    Key knobs (in paper notation):

    * ``txt_in_channels`` / ``txt_out_channels``: the latent dimension
      ``d`` of ``z_0 ∈ R^d`` (Eq. 2.1.1). Must agree with the VAE
      ``latent_dim``.
    * ``txt_dim`` / ``emb_dim``: hidden width of the DiT trunk and the
      AdaLN timestep embedding.
    * ``heads`` / ``head_dim`` / ``expand_ratio``: attention and SwiGLU
      FFN shape.
    * ``num_layers``: depth of the DiT trunk.
    * ``patch_size``: 1-D patchification factor over the latent
      sequence axis (1 in the released checkpoint).
    * ``rope_dim``: number of channels per head that receive RoPE
      positional encoding.
    * ``block_size``: per-sample factor that defines how the latent
      sequence is split into ``B`` generation blocks
      ``z_0 = (z_0^(1), ..., z_0^(B))`` (Eq. 2.1.4). Concretely, both
      the block-causal attention pattern (visible set ``V_b``) and the
      inference loop in :func:`generate_task_repaint_inference` advance
      one ``block_size`` chunk at a time.

    Defaults match the released ~1.8B-parameter DiT prior from the
    paper's RQ4 scaling curve (24 layers × 16 heads × 128 head_dim).
